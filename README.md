Lab Instructions
You have been tasked with deploying some basic infrastructure on AWS to host a proof of concept environment. The architecture needs to include both public and private subnets and span multiple Availability Zones to test failover and disaster recovery scenarios. You expect to host Internet-facing applications. Additionally, you have other applications that need to access the Internet to retrieve security and operating system updates.

Task 1: Create a new VPC in your account in the US-East-1 region
Task 2: Create public and private subnets in three different Availability Zones
Task 3: Deploy an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC
Task 4: Provision a NAT Gateway (a single instance will do) for outbound connectivity
Task 5: Ensure that route tables are configured to properly route traffic based on the requirements
Task 6: Delete the VPC resources
Task 7: Prepare files and credentials for using Terraform to deploy cloud resources
Task 8: Set credentials for Terraform deployment
Task 9: Deploy the AWS infrastructure using Terraform
Task 10: Delete the AWS resources using Terraform to clean up our AWS environment
The end state of the AWS environment should look similar to the following diagram:
